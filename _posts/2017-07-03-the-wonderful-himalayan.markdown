With over 500 hours already logged on this project, we're proud to announce the upcoming full-length skate video featuring Ty Stone, Ivan Gaal, Ted Lee, Julian Leon Gibson Malik Bennet and others.

While originally started out as a personal goal to film a part, this quickly evolved into a year-long project. 

> I felt like my knees were going out. I've been skating for over 25 years, it's all I know. I can't imagine a life without it. Not only was it a huge challenge to go out and film every weekend, but it's forced me to analyze the way I live my life and how I take care of myself. No more disappearing into an alcoholic vortex for this lil skate rat. <cite>- Lorem Ipsum</cite>

While I can't even begin to explain how fun it's been working on this project, it's not to say that it's been easy. Each one of us has faced injury, aging, and conflicting work schedules. We're all weekend warriors. When we started, I already felt like my knees were going out. I've been skating for over 25 years, it's all I know. I can't imagine a life without it. Not only was it a huge challenge to go out and film every weekend, but it's forced me to analyze the way I live my life and how I take care of myself. No more disappearing into an alcoholic vortex for this lil skate rat.
